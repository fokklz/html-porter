# HTML-Porter

This is a compact extension crafted for friends to aid them in their HTML projects. They are required to use plain HTML, CSS, and JS for their assignments, and are prohibited from using any frameworks or libraries.

This tool empowers them to leverage some of the features typical of frameworks and libraries without actually integrating them â€“ such as importing HTML files into other HTML files.

**No tests, no optimizations yet.**
*Perhaps I'll introduce a more streamlined setup in the future. :)*

## Usage

while in a HTML file u would like to use as a template (for exmaple: navigation.html), add it as template by running the `Add Template` command.
you can then use the `Use Template` command while in a empty line in a HTML file to insert the template.

it will automatically update if the template changes, remove itself when the template has been deleted.
